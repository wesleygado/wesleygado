## Hi!

My name is Wesley, and I am a full-stack developer with a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from the Federal Institute of São Paulo.  

I specialize in backend development, with solid experience in the following stack:  
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**  
- **Node.js**  
- **Prisma/TypeORM**  
- **REST APIs**  
- **Relational databases** (MySQL, PostgreSQL)  
- Among other technologies.  

Recently, I have been expanding my knowledge in frontend development, gaining experience with **Next.js** and **React**.  

I have 10 years of experience as a developer and 5 years as a programming instructor. My journey is defined by continuous learning and sharing knowledge, always improving my skills and taking on new responsibilities.  

Currently, I work mainly with the **JavaScript ecosystem**, both frontend and backend (**Next.js, React, Nest.js, Node.js, TypeScript**), as well as **Ruby on Rails**.
